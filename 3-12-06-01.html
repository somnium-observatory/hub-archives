LOG OF EXPLORATION CAPTAIN S.MATHERS

We don't know what we expected to find. We expected something, at least. When our division was created, after that initial rush of exploration and construction and investigation, our team's first instruction was to explore our immediate surroundings. So we were granted this vessel, powered by a variant of that faint blue energy, and we set off into the infinite white of what we then thought was the First. The final broadcasts we recieved before dropping out of range several weeks ago revealed it was in fact the Third, but that hardly matters anymore. What matters is that we have been on this fucking ship for four months, and we have not seen a thing other than that endless, timeless blank void. 

The supplies ran dry by the two month mark. Only a week after that was it revealed that we did not in fact need them, we never did. Our bodies are perfectly fine, nourished by some unholy miracle on behalf of this accursed place. Our minds, on the other hand... The fuel ran out around the time the food did, and with that we were locked on our course. Never slowing, never able to turn, drifting further away from the only outpost in this entire layer. And with that, the gradual realisation that this is all we will ever know slowly settled in on the crew. Hah, I tried to stay reasonable, but even now I can feel the weight of it all settling in on my shoulders. The weight of infinity. The weight of that horrid, eternal, glaring emptiness.

This will likely be the final log I bother to make. We are out of transmission range, but perhaps one of the other crews may pick this up. God, I hope they do. She must know the futility of this all. This was our first mistake, and it must not be repeated.
